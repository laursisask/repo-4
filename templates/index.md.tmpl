# DaVinci Provider

The "davinci" provider allows operators to manage PingOne DaVinci infrastructure
as code. This provider can be used along with the [PingOne provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/pingidentity/pingone/latest/docs)
to stand up fully orchestrated PingOne IAM Experiences.

## Getting Started

This provider will authenticate an API client to PingOne to configure to the DaVinci environment.

### PingOne SSO

You must have a PingOne account and may use multiple environments within that account.

Prerequisites:

- Have a PingOne environment
- Add the DaVinci service to your Administrators environment
- Choose or create a user identity in the Administrators account, 
  give this user the Environment role over the admin Organization.
- For each additional DaVinci environment that needs SSO access,
  give this user the Identity Data Admin role for that environment.
  This step can be done in HCL as shown below:
